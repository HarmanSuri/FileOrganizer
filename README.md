# FileOrganizer
Organizes files by moving them into newly created folders, depending on the files extension.

# How to Use
Place file_organizer.py into a folder you would like to organize. The program currently creates
a Documents folder for .txt, .doc, .docx, .rtf, and .pdf files, an Images folder for .jpg, .png,
.bpm, and .tiff files, and an Applications folder for .exe files. After running the program
you will see that three folders have been created and any files that have the appropriate
extentions will be moved into their respective folders.
